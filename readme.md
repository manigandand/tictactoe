**Tic-tac-toe**, **noughts and crosses**, or **Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies”** , is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

To win the game, a player must place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
